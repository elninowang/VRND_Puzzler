# Puzzler VR 

## Outline

This is a puzzler project with magic ambience. In this game, you will be invited to a dungeon, which is full of medieval and magical atmosphere. Without addressing the puzzler, you won’t be able to get out. The puzzler is simple. There will be 4 rooms in the dungeon, and each room has a puzzler with lighted up in certain sequence after you getting in. What you have to do is to remember the sequence, and redo it. Sounds as hints will help you to address it. I hope the player enjoys this puzzler.

## User Testing outcomes and iteration

### User test 1:
1. How do you describe your environment?

"I feel very comfortable and very well.I heard different environmental sounds in the open valley under the beautiful moonlight.I saw a dungeon invisible.It was an artifact that pushed me into the dungeon.I Heard a very eerily controlled voice, surrounded by four torches that did not glow, and saw two blue balls suspended in the air "

2. Can you describe your feelings at the scene?

"I think the room is too small"

3. Do you see everything clearly?

"Can see everything"

### User test 2:
1. How do you describe your environment?

"Feeling a very empty environment, I saw a room, a few balls drifting inside, and I walked into the room. The room was weird, the sound was terrible, but the environment did not feel horrible at all.

2. Can you describe your feelings at the scene?

"I feel like I'm really younger than me."

3. Do you see everything clearly?

"Yes, I see very clearly."

### Result:

2. The room is too bright, to be dimmed
3. The room is too small to zoom in to feel a real room size.

It can be seen that there has been a lot of improvement in the shaping of environmental effects:

## Conclusion

Much of the game's framework has been completed and succeeded in creating a medieval and magical atmosphere. In this game, players can learn how to get started, and if the solve puzzles go into the next room until the final clearance, this is a great opportunity to personally enter a new world.
When developing the game, I devoted a lot of time to stabilizing the movement, making the light intensity appropriate and ensuring that no objects were very close to people.

## Next Steps

1. Make the game more complicated and confused with diverse.
2. Improve the style of exercise to create a different experience.
3. Make the environment more beautiful and beautiful, not so monotonous
